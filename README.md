Welcome to the README for our [**very fun game**]().

## The game

You play this game by searching for a quote. But... a word is missing!

Don't worry, we've found you two options, and all you have to do is guess the right one.

Complete the quote and play again!

## APIs

For this website we are using a [quotes API](https://quotes.rest/) and [synonym API](https://www.wordsapi.com/docs/).

## Functionality

When a user enters a search term, we find a quote and once we have it, pick a suitable word (i.e. likely to have a synonym). We then remove it from the quote and present two options to the user as buttons - the user must choose the correct option!
